# System-Info
A tool written in Python that lets you see and export your system details in one shot.

Note: for now, the sentence written above is what is coming in time and only the export tool is working for now. There is still no text in the program. Each version goes even further with improvements.

## Exporting your info
Click on File > Export and the program first will write in the terminal all of your specs:<br>

Then it will create a file (if it doesn't already exist, in that case the program will write in it)<br>
and it will write all of you system specs in there.<br>

(Actual sys specs)<br>
Then it will send a notification that lasts 3 seconds which will indicate that the program has finished exporting into the file.<br>
